					<h2>
						About Me
					</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I am a student at MIT, where I am studying Computer Science. I was introduced to computers at a young age by my father, and I have been tinkering with them ever since. 
						</li>
						<!-- <li>
							Writing programs, and seeing it make changes on the computer instantly was always exciting to me, so I spent a lot of time doing it! 
						</li>
						<li>
							As a researcher, I wish to improve this interaction between humans and computers, making it more natural. I wish to design and develop better software and hardware tools that can help humans and machines co-create the future!
						</li> -->
						
					</ul>

					<h2>
						Why am I participating in this Brave course? 
					</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							My mother was a high school teacher, and she teaches me that the best way to learn something is to teach it to someone else.
 
						</li>
						<!-- <li>
							I enjoy teaching, because it forces me to think about problems from different perspectives, in search of finding better explanations. It also forces me to learn more, so that I am confident in what I am teaching. 
						</li>
						<li>
							I love programming myself because it helps me express my ideas to the world, and connects me with like-minded people. I wish to teach the same skills to people who are interested in learning them.
						</li> -->
						
					</ul>

					<h2>
						What do I hope to get out of this class? 
					</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>
							I want to become better at teaching computing and concepts, in a way that makes my students more excited in learning them by experimenting with it themselves. 
 
						</li>
						<li>
							My foremost goal in this class is to show that creativity and programming are hard things, but can be mastered with effort.  
						</li>
					</ul>
