# Brave 2023
## Mini Projects

This repository contains the code for two mini projects demonstrated in the Brave Behind Bars 2023 class. 

There are two mini projects here: 
- My Restaurant
- My Personal Portfolio

### My Restaurant
This mini project is geared towards teaching students the basics of HTML / CSS. 
The TAs can use this code as a scaffolding to allow students to play around with functionality, such as: 
- Changing the heading attributes
- Changing CSS attributes for font
- Exploring functionality with backgrounds
- Using lists on a webpage
- And more... 


### My Personal Portfolio
Starting Week 3, students will work on their HTML CSS skills to develop a Personal Portfolio website. 
We have prepared this demo website that I will build from scratch in class to showcase the process. 
The TAs can use this code themselves, but allow the students to start from scratch, and design the website in their own desired style. 


### Javascript
In Week 4, students will start experimenting with Javascript. The goal is to teach the following concepts: 
- Variables
- Branching Statements
- Loops
- Functions

Here, we will store scaffolding code that the students can use to experiment with basic Javascript functionality.
